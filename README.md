# Freedmen's Bureau Digital Annotation Project

A collaborative digital history project to create a public, annotated collection of documents from the Freedmen's Bureau. The goal is to transcribe a selection of bureau records (such as labor contracts or marriage registers) and add scholarly annotations to explain historical context, define archaic terms, and link to related figures or events. This project serves as a public-facing educational resource, preserving and promoting the legacy of African Americans' transition from slavery to freedom.

## Project Scope

This repository contains transcriptions and annotations of selected Freedmen's Bureau documents from the National Archives and other archival sources. Each document is presented in Markdown format with the following structure:

1. **Document Metadata**: Title, date, location, archive reference, etc.
2. **Transcription**: Faithful transcription of the original document text.
3. **Annotations**: Scholarly annotations providing historical context, explanations of terms, biographical notes on individuals mentioned, and connections to broader historical events.

## Goals

- Create a freely accessible, high-quality digital edition of key Freedmen's Bureau records.
- Foster collaborative scholarship among historians, students, and interested public.
- Demonstrate the use of version control and open-source practices for humanities research.
- Provide educational materials for classrooms and researchers.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from students, historians, and anyone interested in this history. To contribute:

1. **Claim an Issue**: Look for open issues labeled "transcription" or "annotation". Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it.
2. **Create a Branch**: Fork the repository and create a new branch named after your task (e.g., `feature/annotate-labor-contract-01`).
3. **Transcribe and Annotate**: Edit the corresponding Markdown file in the `documents/` folder. Follow the formatting guidelines (see below).
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your work is ready, open a pull request from your branch to `main`. Reference the issue number (e.g., "Closes #1").
5. **Peer Review**: Other contributors will review your submission, suggest improvements, and discuss historical interpretations. Be prepared to revise based on feedback.
6. **Merge**: After review, a project maintainer will merge your pull request.

### Formatting Guidelines

- Use Markdown for document structure.
- Transcribe the document text exactly as written, preserving line breaks and original spelling.
- Add annotations as footnotes using the format `[^annotation1]` and define them at the bottom of the document.
- Alternatively, use inline annotations with brackets: `[annotation: explanation]`.
- Include a header with metadata in YAML frontmatter (optional).
