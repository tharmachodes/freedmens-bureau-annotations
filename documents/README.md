# Documents

This folder contains transcribed and annotated Freedmen's Bureau documents.

Each document is stored as a Markdown file with the following naming convention:

- `labor-contract-{number}.md`
- `marriage-register-{number}.md`
- `complaint-letter-{number}.md`
- `school-report-{number}.md`
- `other-{description}.md`

## Structure

Each document file should include:

1. **Metadata** (optional YAML frontmatter)
2. **Transcription** of the original document
3. **Annotations** as footnotes or inline comments

See the project README for formatting guidelines.
